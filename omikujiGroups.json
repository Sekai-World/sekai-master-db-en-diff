The drop rates therefore do not mean that, for example, Omikuji with a drop rate of 1% are guaranteed to appear once every 100 pulls.\n•Drop rates can be viewed from the drop rates tab.\nThe drop rates that are displayed on the drop rates tab are rounded to the fourth decimal place, so the total may not exactly add up to 100%.\n•After starting the SEKAI Shrine Omikuji, even if the app should force-quit or be disconnected without displaying the results screen, pulled Omikuji will be saved and viewable from Omikuji in Custom Profile.\n•The Limited Time Memorabilia from this 2023 SEKAI Shrine Omikuji may be made available again in the future. Any potential future availability is currently TBD.\n•The Omikuji schedule is subject to change without notice.",
